                    <p>Being Straight-Edge had the reputation of being
    aggressive in the 1980's. But when preformed by 
    Dan Brown, it's clean comedy that still has an edge 
    and is aggressively funny.</p>
                    <p>
                        
    Growing up under the influence of Jim Gaffigan 
    and Brian Reagan, Dan combines his real life 
    observations and experiences into a performance
     that is honest and insightful that audiences can
     relate to and laugh at.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dan talks about life from a wannabe superhero's 
    point of view on having to grow up, family and
     relationships while maintaining honest and true.
